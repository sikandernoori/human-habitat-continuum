# Human Habitat Continuum
### The Future of Life

Human Habitat Continuum is an open effort to design the next homes of humanity.

For all of our history, Homo sapiens has lived on Earth.
If humanity is to endure for centuries and millennia, we must learn to live
in environments beyond it.

This project exists to think seriously about that transition.

## What we are trying to do

Human Habitat Continuum focuses on the **design and architecture of human habitats
beyond Earth** — space stations, orbital settlements, and other built environments
where humans can live, work, raise families, and sustain civilization long-term.

The goal is not science fiction.
The goal is to make these environments **designable, buildable, and evolvable**.

We are interested in:
- artificial gravity habitats
- long-term human health in space environments
- closed-loop life support and agriculture
- energy, industry, and maintenance at habitat scale
- architecture, urban layout, and livability
- systems that can last for decades or centuries
- habitats that feel like *home*, not machines

Humans remain the same.
What changes is the environment we build around us.

## Why this matters

Earth will remain our home.
But relying on a single planet limits the future of life.

Living beyond Earth is not about escape or replacement.
It is about **continuity**.

If we want a future where life persists — through natural disasters,
planetary risks, or simply the long arc of time — we must design habitats
that allow humanity to exist independently of Earth.

This repository is an attempt to start that work early, openly, and seriously.

## How this project will evolve

This repository will grow over time into:
- reference architectures for space habitats
- design studies and tradeoffs
- system-level documentation across disciplines
- visual and parametric models
- contributions from engineers, scientists, architects, doctors, and students

The early phase is about thinking clearly and writing things down.
The future phases will add models, drawings, and designs.

## Who this is for

Anyone who wants to help design humanity’s future homes:
- engineers
- architects
- researchers
- medical professionals
- students
- systems thinkers

If you’ve ever looked at a space station and thought,
“this doesn’t feel like where humans should live long-term”,
this project is for you.

This is the beginning.
